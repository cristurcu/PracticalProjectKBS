Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?",

In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1\u00df, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia.

Initially, the swelling was minimal, but now she is finding it difficult to walk and she can\u2019t fit into any of her shoes. Her medical history is significant for systemic lupus erythematosus. She takes ibuprofen and hydroxychloroquine. Her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 153/86 mmHg, and pulse is 88 beats/min. Pitting edema to bilateral knees is noted on physical examination. Urinalysis reveals proteinuria. The patient is started on an immunosuppressant. Two days later the patient returns to clinic complaining of blood in her urine. A urinalysis reveals moderate erythrocytes but is negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, or crystals.

    "raw_response": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symptoms described in the scenario suggest a defect in the repair of DNA damage caused by UV radiation. Nucleotide excision repair is the primary mechanism responsible for repairing UV-induced DNA damage. Defects in this repair pathway can lead to increased sensitivity to sunlight and severe sunburns. Therefore, the likely impaired process in this patient is nucleotide excision repair.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
