While beta-endorphin deficiency may contribute to withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism, it is likely not the sole factor. Therefore, the answer is maybe.\", \"answer_choice\": \"maybe\"}",

Essential tremor is primarily a kinetic tremor, while Parkinson's disease is characterized by resting tremor. However, there can be cases where patients with essential tremor may develop Parkinson's disease later in life. A SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) can help differentiate between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease by assessing dopamine transporter levels in the brain. Therefore, there may be a correlation between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease in some patients, but it is not a direct causal relationship.\",\n\"answer_choice\": \"maybe\"\n}",
