    "question": "A 21-year-old male presents to his primary care provider for fatigue. He reports that he graduated from college last month and returned 3 days ago from a 2 week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia. For the past 2 days, he has developed a worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. The patient has a past medical history of asthma managed with albuterol as needed. He is sexually active with both men and women, and he uses condoms \u201cmost of the time.\u201d On physical exam, the patient\u2019s temperature is 102.5\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/66 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He has tenderness to palpation over his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints and a maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs. Tourniquet test is negative. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nHemoglobin: 14 g/dL\nHematocrit: 44%\nLeukocyte count: 3,200/mm^3\nPlatelet count: 112,000/mm^3\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 142 mEq/L\nCl-: 104 mEq/L\nK+: 4.6 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 18 mg/dL\nGlucose: 87 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 0.9 mg/dL\nAST: 106 U/L\nALT: 112 U/L\nBilirubin (total): 0.8 mg/dL\nBilirubin (conjugated): 0.3 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

    "raw_response": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation with fever, headache, malaise, joint pain, rash, and thrombocytopenia is consistent with dengue fever, which is a mosquito-borne viral infection common in tropical and subtropical regions. The laboratory findings of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia support this diagnosis. The patient's recent travel to Vietnam and Cambodia also increases the suspicion for dengue fever.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

    "question": "A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his physician with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He has had no recent changes to his medication regimen, which includes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine. His temperature is 98.0\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 174/111 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable.

    "question": "A 47-year-old woman seeks evaluation at your office because she has had postcoital vaginal bleeding for the past 8 months with occasional intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge. Her family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. She is the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol. During a pelvic examination, you notice a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. The bimanual examination is negative for adnexal masses. You suspect the presence of carcinoma and, therefore, send tissue samples to pathology, which confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Which of the following is the most likely malignant tumor in this patient?",

DES exposure is associated with clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina in female offspring. The presence of a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina further supports this suspicion. Therefore, the most likely malignant tumor in this patient is A. Clear cell adenocarcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
